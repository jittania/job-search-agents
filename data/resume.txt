PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
Zulily, Full Stack Software Engineer (Vendor Team) – Seattle, WA | Mar 2022 – Dec 2023
Expanded a vendor-facing React form to collect, validate, and persist 30+ new data points across multiple Java backend services and data stores, reducing manual data entry needs by 15+ hours per vendor and accelerating vendor onboarding timelines by over 70% (Additional tech: JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, PHP, MongoDB, AWS (DynamoDB, Lambda, API Gateway), MySQL, PostgreSQL).
Developed a bulk payment download tool using Angular, Java, Elasticsearch and MySQL that resolved client-side timeout failures and improved performance 200%, allowing vendors to reliably download at least 1,000 invoices per request - up from a 50-invoice limit with frequent crashes.
Built a vendor profile cloning tool using React, TypeScript, Java, MongoDB that reduced manual onboarding time by 1 hour per vendor, enabling the platform to scale support for thousands of incoming vendor requests in the following quarter.
Built an image upload feature using React, PHP, and Java for vendor-submitted media assets with AWS S3 cloud persistence, enabling earlier collection of brand content and reducing manual outreach to vendors for missing assets by an estimated 60%.
Redesigned and standardized critical vendor-facing email notifications across multiple services, resolving delivery and copy issues that impacted onboarding and account management for thousands of vendors; reduced email-related support tickets by 60% and created internal documentation adopted by 3+ teams (Additional tech: Java, PHP, Angular, SQL, GCP BigQuery, Google Analytics).
Resolved a critical backend bug introduced by upstream Shopify changes by tracing failures across multiple services; implemented a fix for order ID handling and improved logging and frontend alerting, reducing related on-call support tickets by 90%
(Additional tech: Kibana, Kubernetes, ElastAlert, Datadog, React, Angular, Java, GCP BigQuery, Google Analytics).
Implemented ElastAlert rules with Datadog monitoring to surface payment service failures causing numerous on-call support tickets, reducing time-to-detection for invoice-related issues by over 80%.
Collaborated with Marketing and Legal teams to streamline the vendor-facing UI content revision process, reclaiming 20+ hours of developer time while improving compliance and consistency across the full onboarding experience.
Produced documentation for 15+ services and all Vendor team platforms that lacked setup Runbooks and READMEs, leading to an 85% reduction in service setup times and drastically streamlined process for training new hires.

Zulily, Software Development Apprentice (Vendor Team) – Seattle, WA | Aug 2021 – Jan 2022
Achieved a 95% decrease in average page load times for thousands of vendors by optimizing Java logic in a key microservice responsible for delivering payment data to high-traffic pages.
Improved system performance, reliability, and fault resistance, resulting in a 75% drop in related on-call ticket submissions by revamping a payments management tool and transitioning TypeScript codebase from Angular to React with Redux.

KEY PROJECTS
Underwater Acoustic Messaging Device | Link
Independently designed and implemented a complex embedded system end-to-end, using AI-assisted workflows to accelerate DSP experimentation, firmware debugging, and protocol iteration while maintaining full ownership of architecture and correctness.
Learned C, C++, Arduino, and Digital Signal Processing (DSP) to develop firmware for a texting device that transmits messages underwater using sound.
Wrote embedded C/C++ on a Teensy microcontroller to encode text into acoustic tones via frequency-shift keying (FSK), decode incoming signals with Goertzel filters, and manage a real-time messaging UI.
Collaborated with a hardware engineer on device messaging design and testing using custom PCBs and piezo transducers.

Elpy | Link
Engineered an iOS music discovery app using Swift, SwiftUI and Python, featuring customizable, algorithmic playlist creation.
Gained skills in OAuth, web APIs, object-oriented and asynchronous programming, and agile project management.

Personal Website and Online Portfolio | Link
